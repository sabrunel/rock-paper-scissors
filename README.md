# Project overview

This is the first project from the **JavaScript Basics** section of the [Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics).

The aim is to build a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in the console, then bring it into the browser with a proper UI.

A live preview is available [here](https://sabrunel.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).

# What I learned

- Branching with Git
- Using Javascript to implement the game's logic
- Using DOM methods to bring the game into the browser
- Flexing some CSS skills to make it look decent


# What's next

I'll probably add some assets to the game in order to make it more compelling.
